# ❤️ Heart Disease Prediction Using Machine Learning

## 📌 Project Overview
Heart disease is one of the leading causes of death worldwide. Early identification of high-risk patients can significantly improve treatment outcomes.  

This project implements a complete machine learning pipeline to predict the presence of heart disease using clinical and demographic data. The solution emphasizes interpretability, robustness, and responsible usage, making it suitable for healthcare decision-support scenarios.

---

## 🎯 Problem Statement
Build a binary classification model that predicts whether a patient is likely to have heart disease based on medical attributes such as age, cholesterol, resting blood pressure, heart rate, and chest pain type.

---

## 🧠 Solution Approach
A structured machine learning workflow was followed. Logistic Regression was selected due to its simplicity, transparency, and suitability for medical prediction problems.
